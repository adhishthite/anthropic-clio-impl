Run the code simplifier agent as multi-agent set up for the UI and the Python code.. think hard

<bash-input>pwd</bash-input>

I get this right after I start a run .. because it's not created yet..

---

Looks lonely.. below Run Detail, put actual Run ID in bigger font..

what else can we add to make it better and informative? and also can we make it sticky?

---

commit this and push
