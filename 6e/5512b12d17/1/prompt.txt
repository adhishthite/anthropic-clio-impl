I get this right after I start a run .. because it's not created yet..

---

Looks lonely.. below Run Detail, put actual Run ID in bigger font..

what else can we add to make it better and informative? and also can we make it sticky?

---

commit this and push

---

the python script has a way to transform a sample input right?

I remember giving it data/external file and it moved that to .contract etc..

---

ah right.. so similar to that I am now giving 100k.jsonl.. can you transofrm it to .contract.jsonl?
